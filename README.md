### üìñ Getting Help

`Comment.nvim` provides help docs which can be accessed by running `:help comment-nvim`

<a id="setup"></a>

### ‚öíÔ∏è Setup

First you need to call the `setup()` method to create the default mappings.

> **Note** - If you are facing **Keybindings are mapped but they are not working** issue then please try [this](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim/issues/115#issuecomment-1032290098)

- Lua

```lua
require('Comment').setup()
```

- VimL

```vim
lua << EOF
require('Comment').setup()
EOF
```

<a id="config"></a>

#### Configuration (optional)

Following are the **default** config for the [`setup()`](#setup). If you want to override, just modify the option that you want then it will be merged with the default config. Read `:h comment.config` for more info.

```lua
{
    ---Add a space b/w comment and the line
    padding = true,
    ---Whether the cursor should stay at its position
    sticky = true,
    ---Lines to be ignored while (un)comment
    ignore = nil,
    ---LHS of toggle mappings in NORMAL mode
    toggler = {
        ---Line-comment toggle keymap
        line = 'gcc',
        ---Block-comment toggle keymap
        block = 'gbc',
    },
    ---LHS of operator-pending mappings in NORMAL and VISUAL mode
    opleader = {
        ---Line-comment keymap
        line = 'gc',
        ---Block-comment keymap
        block = 'gb',
    },
    ---LHS of extra mappings
    extra = {
        ---Add comment on the line above
        above = 'gcO',
        ---Add comment on the line below
        below = 'gco',
        ---Add comment at the end of line
        eol = 'gcA',
    },
    ---Enable keybindings
    ---NOTE: If given `false` then the plugin won't create any mappings
    mappings = {
        ---Operator-pending mapping; `gcc` `gbc` `gc[count]{motion}` `gb[count]{motion}`
        basic = true,
        ---Extra mapping; `gco`, `gcO`, `gcA`
        extra = true,
    },
    ---Function to call before (un)comment
    pre_hook = nil,
    ---Function to call after (un)comment
    post_hook = nil,
}
```

### üî• Usage

When you call [`setup()`](#setup) method, `Comment.nvim` sets up some basic mapping which can be used in NORMAL and VISUAL mode to get you started with the pleasure of commenting stuff out.

<a id="basic-mappings"></a>

#### Basic mappings

These mappings are enabled by default. (config: `mappings.basic`)

- NORMAL mode

```help
`gcc` - Toggles the current line using linewise comment
`gbc` - Toggles the current line using blockwise comment
`[count]gcc` - Toggles the number of line given as a prefix-count using linewise
`[count]gbc` - Toggles the number of line given as a prefix-count using blockwise
`gc[count]{motion}` - (Op-pending) Toggles the region using linewise comment
`gb[count]{motion}` - (Op-pending) Toggles the region using blockwise comment
```

- VISUAL mode

```help
`gc` - Toggles the region using linewise comment
`gb` - Toggles the region using blockwise comment
```

<a id="extra-mappings"></a>

#### Extra mappings

These mappings are enabled by default. (config: `mappings.extra`)

- NORMAL mode

```help
`gco` - Insert comment to the next line and enters INSERT mode
`gcO` - Insert comment to the previous line and enters INSERT mode
`gcA` - Insert comment to end of the current line and enters INSERT mode
```

##### Examples

```help
# Linewise

`gcw` - Toggle from the current cursor position to the next word
`gc$` - Toggle from the current cursor position to the end of line
`gc}` - Toggle until the next blank line
`gc5j` - Toggle 5 lines after the current cursor position
`gc8k` - Toggle 8 lines before the current cursor position
`gcip` - Toggle inside of paragraph
`gca}` - Toggle around curly brackets

# Blockwise

`gb2}` - Toggle until the 2 next blank line
`gbaf` - Toggle comment around a function (w/ LSP/treesitter support)
`gbac` - Toggle comment around a class (w/ LSP/treesitter support)
```

<a id="treesitter"></a>

### üå≥ Treesitter

This plugin has native **treesitter** support for calculating `commentstring` which works for multiple (injected/embedded) languages like Vue or Markdown. But due to the nature of the parsed tree, this implementation has some known limitations.

1. No `jsx/tsx` support. Its implementation was quite complicated.
2. Invalid comment on the region where one language ends and the other starts. [Read more](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim/pull/62#issuecomment-972790418)
3. Unexpected comment on a line with multiple languages. [#144](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim/issues/144)

For advance use cases, use [nvim-ts-context-commentstring](https://github.com/JoosepAlviste/nvim-ts-context-commentstring). See [`pre_hook`](#pre-hook) section for the integration.

> **Note** - This plugin does not depend on [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) however it is recommended in order to easily install tree-sitter parsers.

<a id="hooks"></a>

### üé£ Hooks

There are two hook methods i.e `pre_hook` and `post_hook` which are called before comment and after comment respectively. Both should be provided during [`setup()`](#setup).

<a id="pre-hook"></a>

- `pre_hook` - Called with a `ctx` argument (Read `:h comment.utils.CommentCtx`) before (un)comment. Can optionally return a `commentstring` to be used for (un)commenting.

```lua
{
    pre_hook = function(ctx)
        if ctx.range.srow == ctx.range.erow then
            -- do something with the current line
        else
            -- do something with lines range
        end
    end,
}
```

You can also integrate [nvim-ts-context-commentstring](https://github.com/JoosepAlviste/nvim-ts-context-commentstring#commentnvim) using `pre_hook` to easily comment `tsx/jsx` files.

> **Note** - `Comment.nvim` already supports [`treesitter`](#treesitter) out-of-the-box for all the languages except `tsx/jsx`.

```lua
{
    pre_hook = require('ts_context_commentstring.integrations.comment_nvim').create_pre_hook(),
}
```

<a id="post-hook"></a>

- `post_hook` - This method is called after (un)commenting. It receives the same `ctx` (Read `:h comment.utils.CommentCtx`) argument as [`pre_hook`](#pre_hook).

```lua
{
    post_hook = function(ctx)
        if ctx.range.srow == ctx.range.erow then
            -- do something with the current line
        else
            -- do something with lines range
        end
    end,
}
```

The `post_hook` can be implemented to cover some niche use cases like the following:

- Using newlines instead of padding e.g. for commenting out code in C with `#if 0`. See an example [here](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim/issues/38#issuecomment-945082507).
- Duplicating the commented block (using `pre_hook`) and moving the cursor to the next block (using `post_hook`). See [this](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim/issues/70).

> NOTE: When pressing `gc`, `gb` and friends, `cmode` (Comment mode) inside `pre_hook` will always be toggle because when pre-hook is called, in that moment we don't know whether `gc` or `gb` will comment or uncomment the lines. But luckily, we do know this before `post_hook` and this will always receive either comment or uncomment status

### üö´ Ignoring lines

You can use `ignore` to ignore certain lines during comment/uncomment. It can takes lua regex string or a function that returns a regex string and should be provided during [`setup()`](#setup).

> NOTE: Ignore only works when with linewise comment. This is by design. As ignoring lines in block comments doesn't make that much sense.

- With `string`

```lua
-- ignores empty lines
ignore = '^$'

-- ignores line that starts with `local` (excluding any leading whitespace)
ignore = '^(%s*)local'

-- ignores any lines similar to arrow function
ignore = '^const(.*)=(%s?)%((.*)%)(%s?)=>'
```

- With `function`

```lua
{
    ignore = function()
        -- Only ignore empty lines for lua files
        if vim.bo.filetype == 'lua' then
            return '^$'
        end
    end,
}
```

<a id="languages"></a>

### üó®Ô∏è Filetypes + Languages

Most languages/filetypes have native support for comments via `commentstring` but there might be a filetype that is not supported. There are two ways to enable commenting for unsupported filetypes:

1.  You can set `commentstring` for that particular filetype like the following. Read `:h commentstring` for more info.

```lua
vim.bo.commentstring = '//%s'

-- or
vim.api.nvim_command('set commentstring=//%s')
```

<a id="ft-lua"></a>

2. You can also use this plugin interface to store both line and block commentstring for the filetype. You can treat this as a more powerful version of the `commentstring`. Read `:h comment.ft` for more info.

```lua
local ft = require('Comment.ft')

-- 1. Using set function

ft
 -- Set only line comment
 .set('yaml', '#%s')
 -- Or set both line and block commentstring
 .set('javascript', {'//%s', '/*%s*/'})

-- 2. Metatable magic

ft.javascript = {'//%s', '/*%s*/'}
ft.yaml = '#%s'

-- Multiple filetypes
ft({'go', 'rust'}, ft.get('c'))
ft({'toml', 'graphql'}, '#%s')
```

> PR(s) are welcome to add more commentstring inside the plugin

### ü§ù Contributing

There are multiple ways to contribute reporting/fixing bugs, feature requests. You can also submit commentstring to this plugin by updating [ft.lua](./lua/Comment/ft.lua) and sending PR.
